### About:

I am a 2nd year master's student at HSE University, studying Computer Science.
Currently working as a data analyst, I am eager to transition into the dynamic field of web development, and I am enthusiastic about pursuing a career as a Junior Frontend Developer. 
I am currently improving my skills through the RS School Courses "JavaScript/Front-end" program, and I am committed to completing this training successfully. 
In addition, I am eager to expand my knowledge to include backend development, particularly in Node.js. 

During my Bachelor studies in the field of Finance, I successfully participated in a Double Diploma Program, spending a year abroad in France. 
This experience provided me with the opportunity to collaborate with groupmates from a wide range of countries, exposing me to a multicultural environment. 
This enriched my perspective and instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity, making me a strong team player who is well-accustomed to thriving in multicultural settings. 

At 23 years old, I am driven to leverage my academic background and practical experience to contribute to the future of web development as a dedicated and motivated team member.
